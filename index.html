                        Hey! My name is Scott Hastings. Thank you for visiting my site! A little history on myself... I was born in New Orleans,
                        LA to a middle-class family. I moved to Texas at the age of 7, where I attended middle school, high
                        school and some college. I then moved to Miami in the summer of 2014 and began working in the field
                        of substance abuse treatment, and have worked there ever since! Although that field can be very rewarding
                        at times, it is usually very emotionally taxing, and my hope is to begin and build a career in technology,
                        specifically software development, which was my original passion as a kid. Hopefully you find some
                        things you like on here that I have created, by clicking on "Portfolio" at the top, and feel free
                        to message me by clicking on "Contact" as well!
                    </p>
